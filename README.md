## Overview

Farmware is an open source solution designed to revolutionize small row and specialty farming. By automating the spraying process, Farmware helps reduce labor dependency, optimize crop management, and promote sustainability. With a modular architecture, it combines GPS, camera data, and advanced path planning algorithms to deliver precision farming capabilities.

## Core Features

- **Field Mapping**:
  - Use GPS and camera data to create a digital map of the field.
  - Save and reuse mapped field layouts for future operations.

- **Autonomous Path Planning**:
  - Generate optimized routes based on the mapped field.
  - Avoid redundant coverage and minimize waste.

- **Precision Spraying**:
  - Synchronize spraying operations with tractor movement.
  - Monitor and manage spray rate and tank capacity in real time.

- **Open-Source Flexibility**:
  - Fully customizable and adaptable to various farming needs.
  - Community-driven development ensures iterative refinement and innovation.

## Equipment Required

To be able to deploy farmware, you'll need the following hardware:

### Sensors
- **GPS Module**:
  - E.g., [u-blox NEO-6M GPS Module](https://www.u-blox.com).
  - Provides real time location data for field mapping and navigation.
- **Camera**:
  - Any USB or onboard camera compatible with OpenCV.
  - Used for detecting rows, boundaries, and obstacles.

### Actuators
- **Steering Controller**:
  - Motorized or hydraulic system for controlling tractor steering.
  - Options: Arduino, Raspberry Pi motor controller, or CAN bus interface.
- **Sprayer System**:
  - Electronic sprayer with flow sensors and pump control.

### Compute Unit
- **Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or Laptop**:
  - Processes GPS, camera, and sensor data.
  - Runs the Farmware software.

### Power Supply
- **Battery or External Power Source**:
  - Ensures uninterrupted operation of sensors and compute units.

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Autonomous Spraying Prototype**
- Develop and test field mapping using GPS and camera data.
- Implement path planning algorithms optimized for small row farming.
- Create a fully functional prototype capable of basic autonomous spraying.

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Showcase the prototype at the **World Ag Expo** (Feb 11–13, Tulare, California) to gather feedback and generate interest.
- Begin development of a universal, plug and play system compatible with various tractor models and farming setups.
- Enhance the software’s modularity for seamless adaptation to different field layouts and crop types.

### **Phase 3: Scalability and Community Collaboration**
- Expand mapping capabilities to support **3D field mapping**, enabling precision operations on complex terrains and non flat surfaces.
- Transition from tractor-based mapping to drone based solutions, providing aerial views and full field coverage for advanced data collection.
- Build a strong open source community to drive iterative improvements, foster innovation, and ensure the system remains accessible to all farmers worldwide.

### **Our Mission**

The goal of this project is to give small farmers a fighting chance to make their farms viable businesses without spending outrageous amounts on proprietary systems. Take John Deere, for example their subscription service for auto steer costs almost $50,000 per year. **FUCK THAT.** How is any regular farmer supposed to afford that?

Farmware aims to provide a far superior solution for a fraction of the cost. While John Deere’s auto steer works on long straight lines for grain farming, we’re tackling something 100x harder: enabling precise turns and optimized paths for small row and specialty crops. And we’re committed to doing it affordably your vision is for farmers to build their own systems for around $5,000 in parts or purchase a complete autonomous version for $3,000–$4,000 with 40% margins at scale.

This is just the beginning. The true innovation lies in autonomous drones, which will unlock entirely new levels of precision and scalability for farmers. The agricultural technology market is a $200 billion TAM, and we believe it’s ripe for disruption.
